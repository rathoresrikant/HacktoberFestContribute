# River Crossing Competition
This is a simple python game, in which two players has to cross the river alternately.
Player1 starts from an end a and moves on the screen with the help of arrow keys to reach the other end of the river without hitting obstacles. If player1 hits an obstacle its turn for second player to play. 
Bypassing each stationary obstacle will give you five points and bypassing moving obstacles willgive you 10 points.
At the end of each level winner of the round is displayed.
This is my first hand at python game. Feel free to give suggestions.
Hope you enjoy the game! :)
