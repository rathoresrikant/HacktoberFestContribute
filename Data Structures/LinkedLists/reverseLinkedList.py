'''Explanation:
The reverseLinkedList method initially sets previousNode as None, 
currentNode as head and nextNode as the next node of currentNode.
It then iterates through the linked list until it reaches the end of the linked list, 
i.e. currentNode is None (this is the loop’s exit condition).
During each iteration, it sets the next node of currentNode to previousNode for traversal and then
then, sets previousNode as currentNode, currentNode as nextNode for swapping
and then nextNode as its next node (this is the loop’s iteration process).
Once the current becomes None, it sets the head pointer to the previousNode, 
which was the tail of the linked list initially.  '''
